    <p>Recipe for Homemade Pasta</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All purpose flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make a nest with the flour on a clean work surface. Add the remaining ingredients to the center and use a fork to gently break up the eggs. Try to keep the flour walls intact as best as you can!</li>
        <li>Next, use your hands to gently mix in the flour. Continue working the dough to bring it together into a shaggy ball.</li>
        <li>Then, knead! At the beginning, the dough should feel pretty dry, but stick with it! It might not feel like itâ€™s going to come together, but after 8-10 minutes of kneading, it should become cohesive and smooth:</li>
    </ol>
